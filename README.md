# Top Muffin
Top Muffin is a bakery website that I created using Sinatra and CSS Materialize.
The website is visually appealing because there is symmetry and excellent use of colors.
The focus of the web-application was to create an email form that will send a catalog of products to the user.
I accomplished this by using the Sendgrid API.
